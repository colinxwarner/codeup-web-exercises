                    <p>I went to the school of hard knocks where I earned my degree in being awesome. Also, I am a self taught guitarist, dollar tree aficionado, and the president
                        recently gave me a stimulus check. NBD.</p>

                <div>I could tell you but then I'd have to kill you. No, but seriously, it was pretty cool. I did like super top secret stuff like in that one Steven Segal movie.
                    There was like an explosion and I was all like WHOA! and then I was like shooting a gun and BRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!! In your face bad guys!
                    Also a lot of girls are like cool you're a spy but I'm like whatever.

                <div><p>Work Release</p></div>
                <div>Before I was a spy, I had a little legal trouble. Whatever. It's not like it's even a big deal. They never even proved it was me and that judge was like, not cool.
                    And if someone tells you that the cops tasered me and I cried they're lying! I was never even near that petting zoo. Freakin lies man.

            </div>
            <div><p>Test 3</p></div>
            <div><p>This test was to see how many red bulls I could drink. So, my friend Danny, who's totally not stronger than me,
            bet me that I couldn't chug 6 red bulls and run around the Walmart parking lot but I totally could. So I chugged em and I was running
            but then I blacked out. I woke up when the paramedics shocked me with those pads. I jumped out of that ambulance on the way to the hospital though.</p></div>
            <div><p>Test 2</p></div>
            <div><p>Back in Juvie there was this kid named Harold but we all called him Skinny Pete but I don't know why because there was another kid we called Skinny Pete
            and Harold wasn't even skinny and there was actually another kid named Peter but we didn't talk to him alot. Wait, what was the question?</p></div>
            <div><p>Test 1</p></div>
            <div><p>So one time I was setting off fireworks in the park and these cops came and were all like hey you can't set off fireworks in the park at 2 in the morning and I
            was all like THIS IS AMERICA and they were all like you're under arrest Burt and I was like bet I'm not and I set off all of my fireworks and ran and
            it was crazy but then by the time I got home, they were already waiting for me and my mom was mad</p></div>
            <div>
                <h3 style="color: dodgerblue">AWARDS and TROPHIES</h3>
                <div><p>AWARDS</p></div>
                <div><p>I've got so many awards that I can't remember all of them. I once chugged 6 red bulls. Did I tell you that? I'm awesome at karate.
                I'm actually a time traveller but I can only go forward in time and at regular speed. I currently hold the title of backyard wrestling champion
                but that mostly because Chris hurt his back jumping off the roof to try and do this move but I told him he needed a bigger cape.</p></div>
                <div><p>INVOLVEMENT</p></div>
                <div><p>So, for legal reasons, my court appointed lawyer said that I shouldn't admit to my involvement in stuff but you guys seem cool so, I'll tell you some stuff.
                I have completed over 500 hours of community service by court order! That's a record in my town. I was also accused of being involved (never proven)
                in the senior prank where we caught a racoon and put it in the principle's office but later, the racoon bit the principle and he got rabies and was gone the rest of the year.</p></div>
